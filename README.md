Hello World 👋
Coding, coffee, and cat videos! 🚀
Here are some hilarious things about me:

--

🌱 I’m currently learning Java, Groovy, Postgresql, and how to make my jokes funnier (please laugh, I'm desperate 😂)

🔭 I’m working on Improving my Problem Solving skills but let's be honest, my biggest problem is resisting the urge to nap 😴

🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on making Jira Better thru Scriptrunner and Groovy.

😒 I’m looking for help with C++, because let's face it, it's just not as cute and cuddly as Python 🐍

💬 Ask me about Jira, Groovy, LInux, AWS, or how to make the perfect grilled cheese sandwich 🍞🧀

📫 How to reach me: bogdan.radu@b4it.ro, but please don't send me hate mail if my jokes aren't funny. I'm fragile. 😔

⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that "debugging" is just a fancy term for "staring at code until your eyes bleed"? It's true, try it yourself! 🤪
